    <h2>
      Ok, here goes ‚òÄÔ∏è
    </h2>

    <p>
      I am a highly motivated developer always trying to deliver my best in any given situation.
I enjoy teamwork, playing golf, listening to music and creating exciting digital solutions
and I am always hungry to learn more about, and become better at, the craft of programming.
If You read this resume and believe that we can have a rewarding collaboration I am gladly
looking forward to hearing from You üòä
    </p>

    <p>
      I have been working as a full-stack developer since I graduated from the Systems Science program at
Gothenburg University, and have had the chance to try out different technologies and ways
of working. I believe the world of software development is so exciting because there is always something new
to learn and every colleague you meet has got something interesting to share. I want to work where there is an
open and encouraging culture where new things can be tested and everyone feels welcome.
    </p>

    <p>
      I like working as a full-stack developer because I want to see the whole picture and I want to think of the work
I do as a complete solution that is handed over to the user of the product, but also because I am
fascinated about technology in general and think that it is super exciting to do both front-end and
back-end development. My strongest principles within software development that I follow in my daily work is:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>‚ÅÉ Simplicity.</li>
      <li>‚ÅÉ Add new dependencies with care.</li>
      <li>‚ÅÉ Write clear and clean.</li>
      <li>‚ÅÉ Write tests.</li>
    <ul>

    <p>
      I truly enjoy working together as a team, solving problems and making robust, well-tested and
performant software. I guess I am a typical developer in the sense that I really like
to dig down into details and write as efficient and well-structured code as I can. But I really do feel that coding
is teamwork and that you should always discuss and look for a second opinion regarding your solutions.
Both to make better results but also to learn.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently I am working in an agile app-team with system that is built upon a micro service architecture.
I develop new features in the apps and in the back-end services as well as maintaining and green keeping the existing codebase.
The stack consists of .NET, Xamarin, Golang and GraphQL.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also I have a hobby-project that I have been working on during spare time that is available
on the Swedish iOS App Store. In this app I am using an open API from V√§sttrafik, Gothenburg's public
transport provider, to build an app that is - in my opinion - a very useful complement to the
existing official app where you can subscribe and track your most commonly used stops and departures.
It is written in Swift and also includes a home-screen widget and an Apple Watch version. Find
the app by searching for ‚ÄúN√§sta Resa‚Äù on the App Store.
    </p>

    <p>
        Apart from software development I enjoy playing golf, following the Biathlon world cup,
hanging out with family and friends, solving Escape Rooms, running, eating good food and reading the news. I see myself as a diplomatic
and easy going person who likes to have a good time as well as being serious about my work and
I feel very strongly for the tasks that I am involved in.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask them. Looking forward to hearing from you!
